# Medical-Images-Compression-Using-Wavelet-Transform
This project explores the use of wavelet transform techniques for compressing medical images, such as X-rays, CT scans, and ultrasounds. It evaluates different wavelet types and levels to optimize image quality and compression efficiency, providing a balance between detail retention and storage reduction.
